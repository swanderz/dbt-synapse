# Changelog

## v.0.20.0

### Features

- brings compatibility with dbt-core `v0.20.0`
### Under the hood

- 10+ `synapse__` macros no longer have to be defined as they're now auto-defined as part of the `v0.20.0` upgrade. Code footprint is now >37 lines smaller!

## v.0.19.2

### Under the hood

- fix bug introduced `v0.19.1` where the new macros in [dbt-sqlserver#126](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-sqlserver/pull/126) were still being used somehow
- no longer pin `agate<1.6.2` because it now done as part of [dbt 0.19.1](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/releases/tag/v0.19.1)

## v.0.19.1

### Under the hood

- override new functionality in dbt-sqlserver [dbt-sqlserver #126](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-sqlserver/pull/126) that allows for cross-database queries. Azure Synapse does not support this, so `sqlserver__` adapter macros that were previously used by dbt-synapse had to be re-implemented as `synapse__` macros. [#49](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-synapse/pull/49)
- make CI testing auto-start and auto-pause Synapse cluster to save $$$ [#47](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-synapse/pull/47)
## v.0.19.0.1

### Fixes

- Resolves bug where snapshot and seeds materializations weren't working correctly [#45](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-synapse/pull/45) thanks [@alieus]

### Under the hood

- `dbt-synapse` will allow all patches to `dbt-sqlserver` version 0.19
- Per issue with `pyICU` package ([fishtown-analytics/dbt/#3161](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/3161)), temporarily pin agate to between `1.6.0` and `1.6.2`, inclusive, until `dbt` `0.19.1` is released.
## v.0.19.0

### BREAKING CHANGES

- you must change your profile so that `type=synapse` instead of `type=sqlserver`. The reason is that now `dbt-synapse` now fully inheirits from `dbt-sqlserver` rather than being a fork. The benefit now is that you can have `dbt-sqlserver` and `dbt-synapse` coexist in the same environment.

### New features:
- Brings support for
  - dbt v0.19.0 ([release notes](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/releases/tag/v0.19.0)) and
  - dbt-sqlserver v0.19.0.1 & v0.19.0 ([release](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-sqlserver/releases/tag/v0.19.0.1) [notes](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-sqlserver/releases/tag/v0.19.0))

### Under the hood
- the snapshot materialization, except for the [`MERGE` workaround](dbt/include/synapse/macros/materializations/snapshot/snapshot_merge.sql), now depends entirely on dbt-core's global project. Made possible due to tempdb.INFO_SCHEMA workaround [#42](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-synapse/pull/42)
- make the adapter inheirit from `dbt-sqlserver` [#32](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-synapse/pull/32) [#33](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-synapse/pull/33) thanks [@jtcohen6](https://github.com/jtcohen6) [@chaerinlee1](https://github.com/chaerinlee1)
- the snapshot materialization, now depends entirely on dbt-core's global project. See dbt-sqlserver release notes for more info [#44](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-synapse/pull/44)

## v0.18.1
### New Features:
Adds support for:
- SQL Server down to version 2012 
- authentication via:
    - Azure CLI (see #71, thanks @JCZuurmond !), and
    - MSFT ODBC Active Directory options (#53 #55 #58 thanks to @NandanHegde15 and @alieus) 
- using a named instance (#51 thanks @alangsbo)
- Adds support down to SQL Server 2012
- The adapter is now automatically tested with Fishtowns official adapter-tests to increase stability when making 
changes and upgrades to the adapter.

### Fixes:
- Fix for lack of precision in the snapshot check strategy. Previously when executing two check snapshots the same
second, there was inconsistent data as a result. This was mostly noted when running the automatic adapter tests. 
NOTE: This fix will create a new snapshot version in the target table
on first run after upgrade.

## v0.18.0.1
### New Features:
- Adds support for Azure Active Directory as authentication provider

### Fixes:
- Fix for lack of precision in the snapshot check strategy. (#74 and #56 thanks @qed) Previously when executing two check snapshots the same second, there was inconsistent data as a result. This was mostly noted when running the automatic adapter tests. 
NOTE: This fix will create a new snapshot version in the target table
on first run after upgrade.
- #52 Fix deprecation warning (Thanks @jnoynaert)

### Testing
- The adapter is now automatically tested with Fishtowns official adapter-tests to increase stability when making changes and upgrades to the adapter. (#62 #64 #69 #74)
- We are also now testing specific target configs to make the devs more confident that everything is in working order (#75)

## v0.18.0
### New Features:
- Adds support for dbt v0.18.0

- Add CI testing (#19)
- Remove the external table macros in favor of pulling them directly from `dbt-external-tables`
- Bundle the "`INSERT` & `UPDATE`" `MERGE` workaround into a transaction that can be rolled back (#23) 
- Handle nulls in csv file for seeds (#20)
- Verifed that adapter works with `dbt` version `v0.18.1`

## v0.18.0.1
- pull AD auth directly from `dbt-sqlserver` (https://github.com/swanderz/dbt-synapse/pull/13)
- hotfix for broken `create_view()` macro (https://github.com/swanderz/dbt-synapse/pull/14)
- get `dbt-adapter-tests` up and running (https://github.com/swanderz/dbt-synapse/pull/16)
  - make `sqlserver__drop_schema()` also drop all tables and views associated with schema
